Use classList.add to give it a class of drum-pad (per the requirements/user stories). Also, give our div an id. Note that we are using a regular expression to strip the id of any special characters. If you scroll up and take a look at your data set, you'll note that there's at least one id that contains special characters, which would cause problems for us." },

In order to do this, we'll add a 'keyup' event listener to our document. Every time, the user presses a key and it comes up, we'll know! Note that we are passing the user event into our anonymous function. We need that in order to determine which the key the user hit." },
				{ loc: [76, 76], backgroundColor: "#223b57", note: "Declare an object. Note that this object will only be set if the user event's keyCode (e.keyCode) is found within our array of objects (keyCode property).

So, if the keyCode is found, it will set it to that particular object, otherwise, 'obj' will NOT be set (this is important)." },

				{ loc: [89, 89], backgroundColor: "#223b57", note: "If the object is set, then we know we have valid, safe data to play. At which point, we reach into our document and grab that particular audio element by id (note that it was dynamically generated earlier when we looped through our data...we set the id then) and then we'll execute the built-in play method (exists for audio/video elements), which will play a sound!" },

				{ loc: [91, 91], backgroundColor: "#223b57", note: "Give the div with the id that contains our audio element and class of active. I know there is a lot going on here. This is also using a regular expression (like we used when we set the id) to strip the data of special characters. Once, the id, is found, we add the class of active. Note that the active class (in css) has a red-ish background." },
